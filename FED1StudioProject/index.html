                        <h3> Work Around YOUR Schedule </h3>
                        <p>
                            Most of our students are normal working adults with families and other commitments that need to be upheld. This is why we have an convenient and realistic schedule that is flexible with the life of a working adult. We pride ourselves in lowering the barrier of entry into this wonderful profession and hobby. When we started Chef's Toolkit our vision was teaching our neighbors and community the joys of cooking within their schedule.
